# take-grant

Implementation of an algorithm for 𝑐𝑎𝑛_𝑠ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒 verification predicate in Take-Grant protection model. 
Written in Python with help of NetworkX lib.
Linear computation complexity based on the L. Snyder algorithm, parallelism, tests, benchmarks.

use template to run:
```  
python3 can_share.py -f <filename_of_protection_graph.json> -s <source_object> -d <destination_object> -l <rule_label>
```
